      Geoff is a sheep, cattle and wheat farmer from north-western NSW.  
      In addition to this he produces beautifull woodfired pottery, 
      primarily in his japanese-style anagama tunnel kiln.<br><br>

      While Geoff primarily makes pots as a hobby he is very well 
      respected in the woodfiring community and has held a number of 
      very successfull exhibitions.  Previously it has only been 
      possible to purchase his work at galleries, but with this 
      website we are offering you a chance to purchase unique 
      handmade and woodfired pieces for your home
